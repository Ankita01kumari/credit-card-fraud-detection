How can a credit card Fraud happen?
Some of the most common ways it may happen are:
Firstly and most ostensibly when our card details are overseen by some other person.
When our card is lost or stolen and the person possessing it knows how to get things done.
Fake phone call convincing you to share the details.
And lastly and most improbably, a high-level hacking of the bank account details.


Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:
Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
Imbalanced Data i.e. most of the transactions(99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
Data availability as the data is mostly private.
Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.
And last but not the least, Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.
